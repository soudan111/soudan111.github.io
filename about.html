        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>My name is Connor and Iâ€™m a recent UC Berkeley graduate. I received a bachelor of science with honors in genetics and plant biology and a bachelor of arts in classical civilizations. In my studies, I found myself drawn to the study of the natural world and developed an interest in plant development, genetic engineering, and science communication. I will be attending UC Davis in the fall to pursue a Ph.D. in plant biology as an NSF graduate research fellow. </p>
